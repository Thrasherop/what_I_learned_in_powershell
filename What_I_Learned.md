## How Powershell actually works
* Object oriented (in a terminal???)
* Actual commands are structured like "verb-noun"
* Lots of aliases

I firmly believe that knowing how something actually works (as opposed to just memorizing how to actually use it) is the best way to learn something intuitively. Learning these simple things, and playing around a little bit with proper powershell techniques helps me get this intuitive ability. 

## Favorite commands
- By far my favorite is $wsl
    - This allows me to run all my bash commands that I'm familiar with, which is a game changer for me


## Things I won't use but I think are cool

- Execution Policy
    - I'd seen these commands used, but didn't know what they were. It's nice to understand it now


## Conclusion

There is still a lot for me to learn here, but what I have learned is quite helpful and I am much more comfortable in Powershell. Instead of pulling up wsl as my terminal, I plan to start doing Powershell instead. It is just objectively better, especially considering you can use wsl commands inside Powershell. +
